I need this patch to bootstrap gentoo prefix on CentOS-5.8
During the 3rd stage, libffi.so is installed at usr/lib64, but compiler does not search there and failes to link.
This patch makes usr/lib64 to be searched.

wget 'http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/alt/browser/trunk/prefix-overlay/scripts/bootstrap-prefix.sh?format=txt' -O bootstrap-prefix.sh
chmod +x bootstrap-prefix.sh
patch -p0 < bootstrap_x86_64.patch
./bootstrap-prefix.sh
  or 
env MAKEOPTS=-j8 GENTOO_MIRRORS=http://gentoo.gg3.net/ PORTAGE_TMPDIR=/dev/shm/ ./bootstrap-prefix.sh

CAUTION
during installation of linux-header, you must abort it with ctrl-c.
edit usr/lib/portage/bin/ebuild-helpers/unprivileged/chown and add 'exit 0' just after shebang.
then bootstrap again.

after linux-header is installed, usr/lib/portage/bin/ebuild-helpers/unprivileged/chown should be changed to the original
